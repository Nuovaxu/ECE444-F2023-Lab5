## Briefly Answer this question (~half page): What are the pros and cons of TDD?:
The primary advantage of Test-Driven Development (TDD) is its focus on code quality inspection. It's a balanced approach, integrating coding, testing, and design, aiming to rectify standard objectives. Unlike conventional coding practices, TDD emphasizes writing only what's essential.  This approach not only curtails code redundancy but also guarantees that each segment is purpose-driven.  The lucidity of TDD's interface streamlines both code management and maintenance. The modular design further ensures a clear structure. Once all tests pass, it indicates successful validation. Since the development revolves around testing, TDD ensures the correctness and completeness of the code.

However, TDD is not without its shortcomings. Initially, TDD might seem slower, as writing comprehensive tests is time-consuming. Moreover, TDD might lead to over-testing, implying the possibility of creating overly complex test suites, overshadowing the core functionalities, making the maintenance and understanding of the tests more challenging. Additionally, TDD may not capture all types of errors, such as those unrelated to functionality.
